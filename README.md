# Preferences
Before using this app, personalize your settings in the file _BS440.ini_.

# Domoticz
Just uncomment the following two lines in the _BS440.ini_ and fill in the right url! 
Then run it, the sensors will be automatically generated. That easy!

```
[Domoticz]
domoticz_url: 127.0.0.1:8080
```

The optional option _hardware_name_ is the name of the dummy hardware to you can use,
if you leave it empty or commented it out, it uses _Medisana_ as default.

After a first run _BS440domoticz.ini_ is generated. In which you can override
the ids to use (if necessary). Note that the weight sensors are identified by _ID_ and _Unit_
while the other sensors are identified by _idx_ in _BS440domoticz.ini_.
